# 4. Replace Vercel Postgres with Supabase Postgre

## Issues found in the previous lecture
The monthly limit for Written Data in Vercel Postgres, which was used as the Database, was 256 MB, which was exceeded in one day.

As it is, the data cannot be written and is useless, so let's replace Database with another service, Supabase.

## Create a project with Supabase
- Open the Storage tab of the Vercel project you created last time and click the Connect Store button.

## Replace local app database with Supabase

- Settings > Database > Connection Pooling Custom Configuration > Connection string and click Copy.
![](images/2023-11-23-23-25-10.png)

- Open the previously developed app (learning-phase-4) in Visual Studio Code.
  - Click `File > Open Folder... ` and select `learning-phase-4` folder.
    ![Open Folder](images/1/2023-11-17-08-40-25.png)

- Paste the copied URI into the POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL value in the .env and replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with the password you wrote down. Also, add `?pgbouncer=true&connect_timeout=15` to the end of the URI. Also, delete the other lines as they are unnecessary.

- Click Copy in Settings > Database > Connection string > URI.
![](images/2023-11-23-22-50-12.png)

- Add a line POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING to your .env, paste the copied URI into the value and replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with the password you wrote down.
![](images/2023-11-23-23-03-12.png)

- Execute the following two commands.

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

```bash
npx prisma migrate reset
```

If the .env setting is correct but the command does not succeed, please check if your IP address is not registered in Supabase Settings > Database > Network Bans, and unban it if it is registered.

- In Supabase's Table Editor, you can confirm that the table has been created and the Seed data has been registered.

- Let's change the name of Pet in Supabase's Table Editor.
![](images/2023-11-23-23-43-15.png)

- The name is also changed in PrismaStudio, which is started by the following command. This means that the database has been replaced by Supabase.

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

## Replace the database of your Vercel app with Supabase
Next, let's replace the database of the app deployed in Vercel with Supabase.

- Reopen this screen and click the Resume Setup button (if you reopen it, it will be the Add Integration button).

![](images/2023-11-23-23-53-11.png)

- Select Vercel Project and Supabase Project and click Add Integration !
![](images/2023-11-23-23-57-46.png)

- Click on the Storage tab.
![](images/2023-11-24-00-01-06.png)

- Select learning-phase-4-postgres.
![](images/2023-11-24-00-17-07.png)

- Select Projects in the lower left corner and perform a Remove Project Connection to the learning-phase-4 project.
![](images/2023-11-24-00-17-34.png)

- Click Remove Connection.

![](images/2023-11-24-00-18-21.png)

- Open the Storage tab of the learning-phase-4 project and you will see that it is now unconnected to Vercel's Postgres.
![](images/2023-11-24-00-19-06.png)

- Open Settings > Environment Variables, add the following two environment variables with the same values as the local .env and click the Save button.
  - POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL
  - POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING
![](images/2023-11-24-00-22-55.png)

Next, run Deploy to reflect the environment variable changes in the app on Vercel.

- On the Deployments tab, under Latest Deployments, click on Redeploy.

![](images/2023-11-24-00-26-35.png)
- Click Redeploy.

![](images/2023-11-24-00-27-33.png)

- After deployment is complete, click on the Visit button !
![](images/2023-11-24-00-30-22.png)

- Add `/api/pets` to the end of your browser URL.

![](images/2023-11-24-00-31-17.png)

- You will see the pets with the names you changed in Supabase.

![](images/2023-11-24-00-31-38.png)

Now you have replaced the database of the application deployed in Vercel with Supabase.
